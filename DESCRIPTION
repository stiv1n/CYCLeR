Description: CYCLeR is a software package for assembly of circRNA transcripts from 
	     	RNA-seq data. Takes a set of BSJ prediction files and RNA-seq BAM files as an input
		and outputs circRNA trascnripts as FASTA, GTF and flat annotation files. The tools 
		also outputs a padded FASTA to serve as an index for transcript EM abundance estimation.
